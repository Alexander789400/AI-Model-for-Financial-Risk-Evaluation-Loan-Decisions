A machine learning–based project that predicts loan approval outcomes by analyzing financial and demographic risk factors. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation for intelligent loan decision-making.

*This synthetic dataset comprises 20,000 records of personal and financial data, designed to facilitate the development of predictive models for risk assessment. It serves two primary purposes:

Risk Score Regression : To predict a continuous risk score associated with each individual's likelihood of loan default or financial instability.

Binary Classification : To determine the binary outcome of loan approval, indicating whether an applicant is likely to be approved or denied for a loan.
